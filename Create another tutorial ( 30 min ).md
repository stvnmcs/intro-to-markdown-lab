# How to create the perfect sandwich

In sandwich making there are many steps and ingredients to keep track of. When all the ingredients are assembled, the ideal outcome should be delicious.

## What is a sandwich?

A sandwich is the combination of two slices of bread with an array of deli styled ingredients used in the middle. 
The ingredients *can* be:
* Bread
* Deli Coldcuts
* Mayo 
* Mustard
* Lettuce
* Tomato
> A hotdog, although a deli style grounded beef in a casing with a bread on each side may look like a sandwich, is considered by most sane people not a sandwich.
